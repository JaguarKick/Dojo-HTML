    <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
        <h3>Sun</h3>
    <p>At the center of our Solar System we have our Sun. Sun is a star which has been emitting light, heat and energy for approximately 4.5 billion years. Sun is a giant nuclear reactor which is generating energy using a process callled Fusion. Hydrogen atom fuse with another Hydrogen atom to form Helium. During this process a energy in the form of heat and light is emitted. Sun has been doing this for the past 4.5 Billions year and it has enough fuel to continue this for another 4.5 billion years. Eventually when the hydrogen fuel runs out, Sun would turn into a RED Giant; engulfing the nearby planets and eventually dying.</p>
    
        <h3>Mercury</h3>
    <p>Mercury is the first planet our Solar System. This planet is closest to the Sun. It is also the smallest planet of our Solar System. Mercury is known to have nearly no atmosphere. This is because all the solar radiation has blown away the atmosphere. Mercury is tidally locked to the Sun which means that one side of Mercury always faces the Sun. The other part remains in dark. Recent studies has reveals that the dark region of Mercury has some ice formations even though it's closest to the Sun. Mercury has a very small orbit around the Sun.</p>
        <h3>Venus</h3>
    <p>Venus is the second planet of our Solar System. This planet is named as the greek "Godess of Love". Venus is also the hottest planet of our Solar System. The reason for this is the atmosphere of Venus which majorly consist of green house gas Carbon-di-Oxide. CO2 traps nearly all heat from the Sun making the planet really hot. Also the atmosphere on Venus is incredibly dense. It is so dense that the atmosphere exerts te same amount of pressure that someone would experience at the bottom of Mariana Trench. Venus also has a very slow rotation. It's so slow that a day on Venus is more that one Venus year. Venus also revolves around the planet in an opposite direction compared to other planets.</p>
        <h3>Earth</h3>
    <p>Earth is the third planet of our Solar System. This planet is also known as the blue planet. It is known as the blue planet because 75% of the Earth's surface is covered with water. Earth is the only planet which has life inhabitting. This is because Earth revolves around the Sun in a zone called "Goldy lock Zone". This zone has the ideal distance for a planet to substain life in it.</p>
        <h3>Mars</h3>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet of our Solar System. This planet is also known as the RED planet. It appears red in color because of high concentration of Iron Oxide. Mars has a very thin atmosphere however existance of Iron Oxide proves that it once had Oxygen rich Atmosphere. Mars is also known to hav the largest mountain in the entire Solar System called "Mount Olympus Mon". This mountain is known the be atleast 3 times larger than Mount Everest.</p>
        <h4>Asteriod Belt</h4>
    <p class="asteriod">There is a zone between planet Mars and Planet Jupiter that is known to have millions of rocky objects floating around in an orbit. It almost appears to be like a belt. These rocks are the remains of a planet which wasn't able to form into a complete planet. The gravitational force from Jupiter and Sun didn't let the planet to form.</p>
        <h3>Jupiter</h3>
    <p>Jupiter is known as the largest planet of our Solar System. This planet is a gas giant. The most distinctive feature of Jupiter which is clearly visible to us is the colorful texture and a red swirling cloud. This cloud is known to be a massive hurricane which has been going on for many decades.</p>
